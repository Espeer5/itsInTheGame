# itsInTheGame
Behavioral Game Theory Project, Fall 2023

This project attempts to construct maximally distinguishable 2x2 game matrices 
to determine which of level-k theory, Nash equilibrium, Poisson cognitive
hierarchy theory, and quantal response equilibrium most closely predicts
behavior in 2x2 games.
