# itsInTheGame
Behavioral Game Theory Project, Fall 2023

This project attempts to construct maximally distinguishable 2x2 game matrices 
to determine which of level-k theory, Nash equilibrium, Poisson cognitive
hierarchy theory, and quantal response equilibrium most closely predicts
behavior in 2x2 games.

# CURRENT STATUS:
- GameBoard representation implemented
- nash solver implemented
- qre solver/curve solver implemented
- PCH solver implemented
- Reinforcement learning/self play used to generate simulated data with neural networks
- Parameters estimated from neural network data
