"""This module constains utility methods needed for measuring the
distinguishability of the three models on a single game matrix.
Distinguishability is here the average distance of any single model's 
prediction from the centroid of the three model predictions, which 
accounts not only for the pairwise distance between the models, but how 
dispersed and non-central all 3 models are from each other."""
