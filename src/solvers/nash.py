""" This module computes the Nash equilibrium solution for a 2x2 Game 
object. The Nash solution is either pure or mixed strategy, in both cases 
represented as the probability of playing each strategy as a tuple of 
(row player p(row = 1), col player p(col = 1)).

This approach is based on the paper "Non-Cooperative Games" by John Nash (1951).
